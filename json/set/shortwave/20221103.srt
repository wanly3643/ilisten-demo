1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
hey folks Aaron Scott here so Daylight

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,339
Savings Time ends this weekend which

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,980
means we get an extra hour of sleep this

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,059
Sunday at 2 A.M but it is an hour that

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,240
we lost earlier in the year in March and

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,000
of course people have strong feelings

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,859
about this whether we should change the

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,260
time at all and in which direction the

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,760
US government has even taken up the

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,220
issue and a big question in this

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,019
daylight savings debate is how it

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,420
affects People's Health so we talked to

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,520
health correspondent Allison Aubry this

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,239
past spring to get some answers

15
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,520
you're listening to shortwave

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,559
from NPR

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,800
so much of life is about trade-offs you

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,440
give a little you get a little and we've

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
got a trade-off today that I sure have

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
thoughts on maybe you do too what about

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,940
you Allison Aubry yes I've got some

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,340
thoughts okay we're talking dear

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,199
listeners about the twice yearly

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,239
changing of the clocks spring forward

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,399
when Daylight Saving Time begins and

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,680
fall backward when it ends it may not

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,600
sound like a big deal but it turns out

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,299
our bodies are a lot more sensitive to

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,479
time than most of us ever realized and

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,200
back in 2015 I spoke to the Circadian

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,540
scientist named Fred Turek at

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,460
Northwestern University about it yeah

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,860
let's listen to some of that we've known

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,840
for a long time about the Master Clock

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,180
in our brains that synchronizes our body

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,880
to the 24-hour light dark cycle but in

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,860
recent years scientists have made a

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,020
pretty cool Discovery it turns out that

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,659
we have different clocks in every organ

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,020
yes there are clocks in all the cells of

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,900
your body wow it's kind of stunning yes

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,960
that is a discovery that's literally

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,880
surprised us I must say Turek says think

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,740
of all these clocks in our bodies as

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,899
instruments or players in an orchestra

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,060
the idea that the heart has a clock

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,500
think of it as a drum

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,820
and the kidneys the kidneys have a clock

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,860
two clocks one in each kidney maybe

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,880
they're the horns

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,758
then there's the pancreas oh yes the

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,180
pancreas has a clock that's the flute

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,060
foreign

54
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,099
s is like the Symphony conductor keeping

55
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,280
all of the players in sync

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,379
once the conductor comes on everybody's

57
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,780
in synchrony and it sounds beautiful

58
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,459
the idea that your body is functionally

59
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,340
normally when everybody's in synchrony

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,560
with the master conductor in your brain

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,780
you're sleeping well eating regularly

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,780
and feeling good but what if the clocks

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,220
get out of sync

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,760
it sounds so bad right ah The Clash the

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,280
cacophony yeah cacophony that's that's

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,739
how I feel uh daylight saving time it's

67
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,540
kind of like oh you're just all over the

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,459
place and that really takes us to

69
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,640
today's debate that if we do away with

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
switching the clock twice a year which

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,540
many scientists say would be a good idea

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,819
the debate is which one is better having

73
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,860
extra sunlight in the morning or the

74
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,739
evening yeah and in a rare bipartisan

75
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,200
moment the U.S Senate voted unanimously

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,879
earlier this month to make Daylight

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,760
Saving Time permanent some states have

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,319
already opted out of the twice annual

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,599
clock Change most of Arizona and the

80
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,879
state of Hawaii for instance remain on

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,980
Standard Time year round

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,900
for any change to permanently do away

83
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
with the clocks changing around the

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,959
country though the House of

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,280
Representatives would need to pass the

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,739
measure too and while this year the bill

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,319
is not likely to become law more than

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,180
ever the discussions seem to be out

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,519
there so today on the show to keep or

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,340
not to keep or what to keep does the U.S

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,920
abandon the clock changing and if so

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,739
what does the science say about whether

93
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,659
the country adopts permanent daylight

94
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,540
saving time or year-round Standard time

95
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,239
you're listening to shortwave the daily

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,540
science podcast from NPR

97
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,540
foreign

98
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,900
it was only two weeks ago that we set

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,120
our clocks forward an hour

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,978
and I had to like remember which buttons

101
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,839
to push on the microwave to make it

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,699
happen but you know unless you went to

103
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,800
bed an hour early most of us lost an

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,040
hour of sleep it's kind of tedious but

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,860
having our bodies adjusted by now you

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,780
would think that it wouldn't be a big

107
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,620
deal to adjust to a one hour change in

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,660
time in this instance losing an hour

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
basically having a 23 hour day once a

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
year but our body's gonna tell a

111
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,320
different story I mean what's surprising

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,139
is that the springtime clock Change is

113
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,660
actually linked to an increased risk of

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,180
heart attacks and other cardiac events

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,460
huh and I talked to a Cardiologist his

116
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,520
name is Jay chudow at Montefiore Health

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
who was actually documented this

118
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,820
phenomenon he compared Hospital

119
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,560
admissions for a type of heart

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,780
arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat called

121
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,540
atrial fibrillation in the days after

122
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,580
the spring time change compared to the

123
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,320
rest of the year we found that there

124
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,720
were more hospitalizations for atrial

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,060
fibrillation after the spring time

126
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,240
change I was very surprised because it's

127
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,759
just one hour change why should it cause

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,860
this large effect he says people who

129
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,080
ended up in the hospital with afib as

130
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,419
it's referred to had other risk factors

131
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,919
too these weren't young healthy people

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,280
so the time change wasn't the sole cause

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
of their event but likely the factor

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,139
that put them over the edge so why does

135
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,440
this happen do scientists know exactly

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,139
why isn't nailed down yet but what has

137
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,660
become clear is that our bodies are

138
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,900
super sensitive to time as we just heard

139
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,060
above a few years back three scientists

140
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,160
actually won a Nobel Prize for their

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,780
work that helped made that discovery

142
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,120
that we have clocks running in every

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,820
organ and every cell of our body and

144
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,680
that we're just orchestral beings

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,560
literally time keeping machines that's

146
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
right it's one way to look at it I mean

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,400
and it really the analogy really does

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
hold up I mean the first rays of light

149
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,080
each morning helps to reset our clocks

150
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
each day and with that abrupt change

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,520
that 23 hour day when we Spring Forward

152
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,460
it can disrupt our internal clocks in

153
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,380
ways that can be harmful in addition

154
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,300
think about this Emily when much of the

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,580
nation is tired and groggy on a single

156
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,979
day from yeah collectively losing an

157
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,840
hour of sleep it can lead to a lot of

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,360
distracted drivers on the road traffic

159
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,580
accidents after the time change there's

160
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,580
definitely a signal that there's more of

161
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,440
those after we change the clocks just

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,539
like there are more workplace accidents

163
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,979
and such and if I can make my own

164
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,560
admission I was involved in an incident

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,600
on the Wednesday after the time change

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,419
last week he collided with another car I

167
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,400
don't have all the details but it was

168
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,220
not his fault and Emily this may seem

169
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,560
like a coincidence but it turns out I

170
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,199
was also involved in a traffic incident

171
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,440
the day of the spring forward change oh

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
no are you okay I am completely fine

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
what happened is I actually backed into

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
to my neighbor's Tesla he was not in his

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
usual parking space I was in a hurry

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
running late and boom it was just easy

177
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
to do I didn't look in the rearview

178
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,979
mirror thousands of dollars later

179
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,479
questioning why this happened I decided

180
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,099
to reach out to the Circadian medicine

181
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,740
clinic at Northwestern I spoke to Dr

182
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,500
Sabra Abbott she's a neurologist by

183
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,599
training and her research focuses on

184
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,300
understanding the impacts of timing on

185
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,919
our health can you claim daylight

186
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,560
savings time is to blame probably

187
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,699
um I don't know if that would hold

188
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,800
import but you probably were sleep

189
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,500
deprived you were probably a little

190
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,000
misaligned and I think that probably

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,340
played a role in that now thankfully no

192
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,580
one was hurt in my fender bender which

193
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,139
is the most important thing but one

194
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,080
study from 2020 found a six percent rise

195
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,080
in fatal car crashes after the spring

196
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,180
time change wow you know the date is a

197
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,560
little bit mixed on this some studies

198
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,020
point to higher risks of accidents in

199
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,699
the morning during daylight savings

200
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,199
months due to the darkness in the

201
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,660
morning it can kind of go both ways but

202
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,419
Abbott says what is very clear is that

203
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,000
there are negative health effects linked

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,280
to Shifting the clocks this is

205
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,259
fascinating to me and and you know it's

206
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,539
tough to determine causality here like

207
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,460
she's saying but part of the scientific

208
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,760
process is stepping back from Individual

209
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,099
experiences and looking at Broad Trends

210
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,200
and if you're saying that health and

211
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
safety kind of Trend in a bad Direction

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,740
around this time of year because of the

213
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,940
clock Change

214
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,679
what is the conversation like about

215
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,720
doing away with it entirely and just

216
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,480
just keeping to one time in the US I

217
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
think there's a lot of support for that

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
um there's support among politicians

219
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,200
among some scientists support among

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
people who are just annoyed by the time

221
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,160
change but I think the big question

222
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,200
becomes which time should become

223
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,959
permanent should we adopt Standard Time

224
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,000
year round with more sunlight in the

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,519
morning or permanently adopt a Daylight

226
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,740
Saving Time with more sunlight in the

227
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,019
early evening as the Senate has voted to

228
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,720
do well if the early race of the sun

229
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,480
reset a human clock wouldn't daylight

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,040
saving time

231
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,080
kind of misaligned with our natural

232
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
rhythms well that's exactly the concern

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,580
and Dr Abbott says a lot of sleep

234
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,800
scientists think that the Senate got it

235
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
wrong one of the consequences of

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,240
permanent daylight savings time is

237
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,820
actually that you end up finding it

238
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,500
harder to fall asleep at night because

239
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,240
you're getting that light later in night

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,700
when it actually pushes time later and

241
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,260
you're getting less of that light in the

242
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,180
morning which makes it harder to wake up

243
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,500
in the morning in fact the American

244
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,300
Academy of sleep medicine has a position

245
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,660
paper on this in favor of moving to

246
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,480
permanent Standard Time so more light in

247
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,060
the morning Yeah it's you're trying to

248
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,500
like align what's happening in the

249
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,720
environment with the clock in a person's

250
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,660
body so if sleep doctors mostly prefer

251
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,540
permanent Standard Time why did the

252
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,279
Senate choose the other direction why

253
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,019
did they go for like a permanent

254
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,060
daylight saving time yeah I think to

255
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,339
answer that you have to go way back when

256
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,779
daylight saving time was first

257
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,700
introduced as a concept about a hundred

258
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,800
years ago the idea back then is that it

259
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,860
would save energy if people need it less

260
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,600
power to heat their homes in the evening

261
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,480
there'd be some Energy Efficiency but

262
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,100
it's not clear that this Energy

263
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,959
Efficiency has really ever panned out

264
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,660
the argument today that's more relevant

265
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,360
I think is that more sunlight in the

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,880
afternoon makes it easier for people to

267
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
go out and do things after work and

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,380
spend more money doing it I spoke to

269
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,420
Lyle Beckwith he's with the National

270
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Association of convenience stores and

271
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,700
that group actually lobbied way back in

272
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,660
the 1980s to extend daylight saving time

273
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,000
for a longer stretch of the year for

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,220
this very reason when people come home

275
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,079
from work and there's more Daylight they

276
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,240
tend to be more active they go to

277
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,160
sporting events they play softball they

278
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,040
golf They barbecue and that translates

279
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,260
into an increase in sales of people

280
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,360
coming in to buy more water more

281
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,899
Gatorade more beer more charcoal more

282
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,000
everything they don't have specific

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,339
numbers on this but he says stores tell

284
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,860
him that they see a 15 to 20 percent

285
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,320
boost in sales at this time of year yeah

286
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm guilty of this I'd be in that data

287
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,459
but you know this is just like human

288
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,980
health colliding with kind of economic

289
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,700
health it's a story that is classic and

290
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,820
you said though it's unlikely such a

291
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,399
change will become federal law this year

292
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,959
even if the conversation has been

293
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,720
stewing for a long time you know I think

294
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Congress may end up giving up on the

295
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
measure this year because let's just

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,620
face it there are lots of high priority

297
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,720
issues right now there's Ukraine and

298
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,980
inflation

299
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,060
um I mean in the House of

300
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,740
Representatives does not have a plan at

301
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,260
the moment to vote on it though it is

302
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,720
worth noting that it passed the Senate

303
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,060
by unanimous consent meaning no one

304
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,640
objected to it there was no actual roll

305
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,579
call vote uh so it does have some

306
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,640
momentum and if Congress did act many

307
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,860
retailers say they would rather see

308
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,899
permanent minute daylight saving time so

309
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,339
the question is like where does that

310
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,980
leave all of us right as a human being I

311
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,140
mean where I've kind of landed is I get

312
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,420
it that you know Standard Time with more

313
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,880
light in the morning is probably what

314
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,579
our natural rhythms are craving however

315
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,980
you know as a person who works during

316
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,560
the day I also like the idea of being

317
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,899
able to like play tennis or meet people

318
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,820
in the afternoon after work and it's

319
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,980
still light so in a way we're kind of

320
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,040
living this compromise you know yeah so

321
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,600
I guess I'll see you at the 7-Eleven

322
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
picking up charcoal for the time being

323
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,320
all right you're inviting me over for a

324
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
barbecue is that right yeah I have that

325
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,500
right

326
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,620
