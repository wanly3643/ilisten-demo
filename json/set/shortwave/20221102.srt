the nervous one is close by but one

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,599
second

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,199
oh can you mail again

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,960
Katie Woo is a cat person she has twin

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,420
Tabby Brothers Calvin and Hobbes the

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,539
meowing you heard came from Hobbs Hobbs

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,199
is a zoom Enthusiast but a nothing else

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,299
Enthusiast he is afraid of food

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,760
human beings other cats heavy steps

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
vacuum cleaners wind and foil he likes

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,820
having his teeth rubbed so I'm doing

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,059
that to calm him down Katie loves her

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,100
boys but she wasn't always a feline

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,920
mother of two in fact this wasn't a

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,800
situation she ever saw herself in it all

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,760
if we put me 10 years ago into this

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,780
exact room it would be a catastrophe

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,600
tell us about it what would happen oh I

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,580
missed that pun

[Laughter]

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,479
okay okay yeah so basically for the

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,780
first I'd say 20 years of my life I was

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,540
I wouldn't say deathly allergic to cats

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,939
but whatever is one tear below deathly

28
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,979
allergic to cats miserably I'd walk into

29
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,259
a room either where there were cats or

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,659
where cats had recently been or as

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,479
distantly as months ago and my body

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,820
could tell uh my eyes would start

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
watering my nose would immediately clog

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,200
up I would feel my throat tighten it's

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,900
possible for Katie it was genetic it

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,720
happened to my mom too my siblings have

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,280
it it's like this was my destiny or so

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
she thought because sometime between the

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,420
end of college and grad school I was

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,280
suddenly able to be around cats and

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,259
nothing would happen Kitty remembers

42
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,060
that around this time she even went with

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,640
a friend to help them adopt a dog they

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,860
hung out in the shelter for hours there

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,259
were rows and rows of cats in a facility

46
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,440
full of dander and cat hair and other

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,680
cat remnants and she was completely fine

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,420
I did not know what was going on so

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,400
after that I sort of decided to test it

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
out more and more and more and just it

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,099
kept being the case that nothing would

52
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,879
happen people can outgrow allergies but

53
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,980
it seems less common to have the kind of

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,340
complete night and day change the Katie

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,500
experienced so either this is the

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,220
longest fever dream ever

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,319
or something in my body changed that

58
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,420
just decided you know one day your

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,760
immune system is terrified of cats

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,220
and then it got over it so today on the

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,440
show we talked to Katie Wu about the

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,140
complex world of allergies why they may

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,120
happen and what might cause them to

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
change turning even the most catallergic

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,340
into the cat obsessed do you want to

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,819
meow can you meow into a report it

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,379
let's dive into the biology of allergies

88
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,180
you write that they're basically like

89
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,180
little molecular screw-ups what do you

90
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,298
mean by that yeah so I mean think about

91
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,339
the things that people tend to be

92
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,780
allergic to peanuts pollen shellfish for

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,880
most people these are harmless things

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,259
and they should be harmless things but

95
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,000
the sort of classic version of this is

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
you're exposed to something a couple

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,199
times usually early in life there are

98
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,000
some exceptions to that you know maybe

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,220
the first time the body sees it and goes

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,199
huh something about this doesn't sit

101
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,540
right with me some sort of response

102
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,280
develops and the next time that same

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,160
allergen comes around the body's like

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
oh no the last time I saw this I got

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,979
really nervous and now I am giving like

106
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,620
a full-blown freak out Katie says there

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,900
are basically two parts to an allergic

108
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,330
reaction

109
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,360
[Music]

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
step one is your body has to First

111
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,500
recognize the thing as something that

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
just raises it tackles it's called

113
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,180
sensitization something triggers a

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,060
hypersensitivity in the immune system

115
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,979
and then those crazy symptoms are the

116
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,840
actual allergic response so what's like

117
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
detection reaction so when people's

118
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,940
bodies overreact to them you know they

119
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,460
get hives or they go into anaphylactic

120
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,020
shock they stop being able to breathe

121
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,639
like some people can even die from these

122
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,460
reactions these are basically overblown

123
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,020
reactions to something that really

124
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,400
should be harmless

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
from what you write that really

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,600
surprised me is it's not just one

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,300
biological process it's complicated it's

128
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,580
particular to the allergen it differs

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,320
from person to person

130
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
tell us a little bit about what we're

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
learning about how complex it is it's

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,979
not like you can simply look at someone

133
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,979
or even look at their reaction to an

134
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,139
allergen and say oh I know exactly

135
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,060
what's happening molecularly in your

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,979
body which makes it really difficult to

137
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,320
say I have a good plan for treating you

138
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,020
or making these symptoms better you know

139
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,639
the general way that people approach

140
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,139
this and the most common way that people

141
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,180
approach this for a long time was to

142
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,300
give people antihistamines which is

143
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,039
basically treating a symptom of the

144
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,960
allergy but it's not really tackling it

145
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,880
at the source it's not teaching the body

146
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
hey chill out this thing that you're

147
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,080
scared of is actually benign it's really

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,660
just saying let's make you feel better

149
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,419
after your body starts reacting and so

150
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,979
you know a lot of this is like happening

151
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,380
kind of Downstream of the big problem

152
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,419
itself because that can happen in so

153
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,400
many ways and it's also not like

154
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,199
allergies can manifest in the same way

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,319
like think of anyone you know who has

156
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,180
seasonal allergies hay fever they sneeze

157
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,520
a ton when they have pollen

158
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,680
um and then compare that to someone and

159
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
who is allergic to peanuts and is going

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,979
into anaphylactic shock in a restaurant

161
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,340
those things look so different you write

162
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,560
that the world is becoming a more

163
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,979
allergic place that in America alone

164
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,440
there's about 50 million people who

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,139
experience allergies do scientists have

166
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,419
a sense of why this is

167
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,780
I think we have become a very super

168
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,819
clean Society especially in the western

169
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,039
world and kind of ironically like you

170
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,360
would think that leads to people getting

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
less sick but that also means we're not

172
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,259
exposing kids to a lot of the really

173
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,479
good microbes that are helping train

174
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,400
little kids bodies to distinguish good

175
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,740
from bad and so as dietary practices

176
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,199
have changed as we're you know using

177
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,660
tons and tons of antibiotics there are

178
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,180
some thoughts about you know how the

179
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,740
differences of modern childhood are

180
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,319
making it easier for bodies to basically

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,419
get confused about what does and doesn't

182
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,280
belong inside of them and do you have

183
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,560
any sense of how much it's an actual

184
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,979
rise in allergies versus an artifact of

185
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,380
you know people are looking for them

186
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,660
more and that it's it's more a rise in

187
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,020
reporting or a diagnosis yeah that's a

188
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,240
fantastic question and you know to be

189
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,860
totally honest there is a little bit of

190
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,020
both going on but even studies that have

191
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,479
sort of tried to account for the rise in

192
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,280
diagnosis and awareness and just of

193
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,500
parents coming in and being very worried

194
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,539
about this specific thing there does

195
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,940
seem to be a rise in this

196
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,340
um I think any allergist you talk to you

197
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,160
you'll ask them is are kids more

198
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,539
allergic than they were a few decades

199
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,460
ago and generally the answer I've gotten

200
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
is oh yeah

201
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,900
um it's definitely a thing but that said

202
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,419
there is definitely an over-diagnosis

203
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,400
problem with some allergies penicillin

204
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,339
is an amazing example uh apparently 90

205
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,339
of people who have penicillin allergy in

206
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,140
their medical chart don't actually have

207
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,080
a penicillin allergy and this is a huge

208
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,520
problem with drug allergies not just

209
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,500
because there's erroneous information in

210
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,020
those drug charts but because it limits

211
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,399
the options that people can get when

212
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,680
they get a bacterial infection Kitty

213
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,260
what are the ramifications for public

214
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,480
health of having this increasingly

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,060
allergic Planet this is absolutely I

216
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,920
think becoming a bigger issue because

217
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,140
even above and beyond the fact that

218
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,540
allergies can be a debilitating thing to

219
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,459
live with and it is costing a lot of

220
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,800
money and resources to figure out how to

221
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
improve these people's quality of life

222
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,580
and find adequate treatments for them

223
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,080
and to just better understand this

224
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,000
growing phenomenon I think it is

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,560
indicative that we don't fully

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,080
understand just fundamental aspects of

227
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
the immune system if allergies are

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,740
increasing I think that sort of also

229
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,060
speaks to

230
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,459
are we putting our kids in the best

231
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,380
environment should we be taking a closer

232
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,180
look at childhood should we be taking a

233
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,800
closer look at built environments should

234
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
we be taking a closer look at say our

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,480
early relationships with animals or

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,660
other humans and like if there are race

237
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,420
or socioeconomic disparities why might

238
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,600
those be so it's kind of both like an

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,300
effect and a symptom of a bigger problem

240
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,220
that is definitely worth examining

241
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,440
Katie's one of the lucky anomalies who

242
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,300
managed to kick her cat allergy but

243
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,339
allergies change in people all the time

244
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,920
they wax and they Wane and while

245
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,720
researchers don't always know what

246
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,519
determines all of these immune changes

247
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,940
there are some scientific explanations

248
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,680
basically this is called tolerance after

249
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,140
you develop analogy you can lose it by

250
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,420
growing tolerant the antigen your body

251
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,959
learns over time almost like the immune

252
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,120
system version of exposure therapy and

253
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,680
this is the principle behind allergy

254
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
shots right but it's complicated they

255
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,399
don't always work because people's

256
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,860
immune systems are are very weird and

257
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,959
sometimes people just grow out of their

258
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,279
allergies without a super clear

259
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,800
explanation I had no obvious

260
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,540
intervention

261
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,399
um so I am just sort of chalking it up

262
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,160
to the weirdness of immune systems being

263
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,620
sort of sensitive to all sorts of change

264
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,019
over time like how we're sleeping how

265
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,360
we're eating what's inside of our guts

266
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
bacteria wise

267
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,100
um where we live how old we are uh maybe

268
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,540
just the right combination of factors

269
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,420
happened for me at the right time the

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,579
hope is is scientists further unlock the

271
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,560
mysteries of allergies in our immune

272
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,779
systems they'll have more tools to go

273
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,940
about treating them I think there are

274
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,500
definitely people who were talking about

275
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,959
like gene therapy and then of course

276
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,100
there are people who are trying to

277
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,899
figure out how can we tackle this now

278
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,940
than the human side but on the side of

279
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,220
the allergen you know obviously there

280
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,720
have been a lot more accommodations as

281
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,779
of like to make foods more allergy

282
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,640
friendly for kids and then there are

283
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,860
ideas about how to prevent allergies

284
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,959
from manifesting in the first place so

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,240
changing the habits around what you know

286
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,060
pregnant people are told to eat what

287
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,360
lactating people are told to eat just

288
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,680
making sure those exposures are

289
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,240
happening early

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,140
um you know there are some people

291
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,399
looking into whether it's actually

292
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,140
really beneficial to have a pet in your

293
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,360
home when you have a really little kid

294
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,220
um you know to obviously not overuse

295
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,959
antibiotics but I think a lot of things

296
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,399
both on the treatment side and the

297
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,920
prevention side

298
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,660
it's been a pleasure talking allergies

299
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,880
with you thank you so much for uh

300
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
world delighted to be here as always uh

302
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,560

back just say the word cat

304

foreign

305
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,620
depends a lot on our pets a lot a lot a

306
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,740
lot and yes most of the team are cat

307
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,720
people to be honest although I will

308
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,660
voice my doggy descent here so to

309
