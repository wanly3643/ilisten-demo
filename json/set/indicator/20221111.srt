we've got two indicators today one is

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
about FTX a giant cryptocurrency

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,059
exchange that just filed for bankruptcy

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,059
and how the stock market reacts to

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,160
midterm elections that's all coming up

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,640
this like major crypto exchange that is

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,100
basically imploding right now where do

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,400
we start yeah so so my indicator is 32

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,680
billion dollars big indicator that's

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
huge it's the amount of value that has

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,119
disappeared from FTX earlier this year

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
investors were valuing it at 32 billion

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,460
and now one of the Venture Capital firms

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,640
that invested is valuing it at zero

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,460
dollars 32 billion to zero dollars yes

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,700
holy moly okay I have to admit I had not

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,759
actually ever heard

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,860
FTX until this week that might be true

39
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,579
but a lot of people heard about FDX in

40
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,439
the Super Bowl oh they had a commercial

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,280
of course I call it the wheel got a

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,340
stone wheel what does it do it it rules

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,560
yeah it's not as a bagel okay a bagel

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
you can eat

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,280
Larry David here Shilling for crypto

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,520
it's like an expensive commercial yeah I

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,439
mean they were riding high at the time

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,380
but their fortunes have kind of Fallen

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,919
back to Earth this week so FDX froze

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,099
uses withdrawals and that has shaken up

51
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,080
the crypto World in general the

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,599
protagonist is Sam bankman freed and he

53
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,340
goes by SPF the FTX guy goes by SBF okay

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,640
so anyways Sam bankman freed he's a 30

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,980
year old guy with a mop of hair he wears

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,860
shorts a lot he's really Earnest and

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,720
he's kind of been seen as the good guy

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,000
in crypto even though he was worth an

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,340
estimated 15 billion dollars before this

60
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,680
week it go to Washington DC and it Lobby

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,900
in support of more regulation of

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,180
cryptocurrencies here he is testifying

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,920
at a senate hearing earlier this year I

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,500
agree I would love to see the cftc play

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,260
a more active role in uh licensing and

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
regulating the digested space and I

67
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,099
agree that that will likely and he's

68
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,660
been giving a lot of interviews he

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,819
seemed super transparent about what he

70
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,280
was doing and including with NPR's David

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,680
gura in June about how he could even

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,540
step in when other crypto companies were

73
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,480
facing trouble I do feel like we have a

74
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,760
responsibility to seriously consider

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,220
stopping in even if it's at a loss to

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,360
ourselves

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,159
um to spread contagion and even if we

78
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,720
weren't the ones who caused it or were

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
involved in it and to understand and

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,379
what went wrong this week you need to

81
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,420
know that he has businesses in two

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
separate categories an exchange and a

83
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,760
trading firm so the exchange is FTX

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,340
which at its heart is just meant to be a

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,620
Matchmaker it matches crypto buyers with

86
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,599
crypto sellers like the stock exchange

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,360
and then on the other side SPF also

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,879
founded a crypto trading firm and that

89
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,280
is a company called Alameda research and

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
Alameda research borrowed and speculated

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,200
and tried to make money in crypto and in

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,540
theory this is still legal okay so you

93
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,060
have this like boring exchange as one

94
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,519
company and then the more risky money

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,220
maker on the other side two separate

96
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,620
companies yeah but SBF is heavily

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,840
involved with both okay and it's been

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,060
reported that several months ago Alameda

99
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,340
research made some bets that went badly

100
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,040
so I needed to borrow some money and

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
there's been reports from the Wall

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,700
Street Journal that it borrowed around

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,060
10 billion dollars from FTX oh so he

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,220
borrowed from his other company yeah

105
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,720
okay and that shouldn't have happened

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,840
the way it did where did FDX get that

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,240
eight billion dollars from well part of

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,919
it happened from the accounts of

109
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,380
everyday people just using fgx to buy

110
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,139
and sell crypto oh okay you know in the

111
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,460
everyday banking world this kind of

112
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,620
thing would not be allowed but to make

113
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,020
matters worse there was this problem

114
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,000
with the collateral that Alameda

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,220
research used to borrow the money so you

116
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,440
know collateral you often use when you

117
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,660
borrow money like maybe a house if

118
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,100
you're getting a home loan right so the

119
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,419
bank can just like take your house if

120
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,220
you don't pay back your loan right yeah

121
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,280
and in this case Alameda research is

122
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,139
collateral was a token issued by FTX so

123
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,120
the whole thing was just kind of a snake

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,580
eating its tail it wasn't very useful

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,740
collateral whatsoever it keeps getting

126
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,320
sketchier and sketchier exactly so it

127
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,060
was all just based on confidence and and

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,639
then once that confidence started to you

129
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,860
know disappear a little bit then

130
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,160
everything kind of collapsed and so SBF

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
called out for help from his former

132
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,320
Mentor Chung ping Zhao or actually likes

133
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,100
to be called CZ and he is the CEO of the

134
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,560
largest crypto exchange binance and

135
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,660
these two people don't always get along

136
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,360
like for one thing he is not a fan of

137
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,820
more crypto regulation like SPF is okay

138
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,060
and on Tuesday SBF announced that cz's

139
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,820
company binance was looking into bailing

140
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,300
out FDX but then the next day on

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,479
Wednesday CZ backed out of the deal he

142
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,460
said quote the issues are beyond our

143
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,520
control or ability to help wow brutal

144
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,919
pretty honest and that day it was

145
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,720
reported the Security and Exchange

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,580
Commission and the Department of Justice

147
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,860
were investigating FDX not to mention

148
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,100
more overseas investigations and this

149
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,740
morning FTX and Alameda research were

150
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,100
filing for bankruptcy and SBF resigned

151
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,820
as fdx's CEO oh my gosh it just keeps

152
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,100
getting worse so overall looking at this

153
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,319
yes it's been pretty fascinating to

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,080
watch this 32 billion dollars go up in

155
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,840
flames and this huge Fall From Grace for

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,860
SPF and big picture I mean this could be

157
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,380
the spark for what SBF was kind of

158
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,600
asking for all along stronger regulation

159
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,139
of crypto yeah exactly yes yes so it

160
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,120
could look more like regular financial

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,340
markets in the future and regular

162
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,539
financial markets are what you're going

163
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,639
to discuss take us away okay yeah I want

164
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,139
to focus on the standard stock market

165
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,000
especially after a midterm election so

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
my indicator I'm playing a little fast

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,580
and loose with it here but it is four as

168
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,860
in the midterm elections which happen

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,840
every four years got it a little bit of

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,360
a stretch but the midterms and the stock

171
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,800
market have this like pretty consistent

172
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,139
serious long-term relationship going on

173
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,560
okay is a ring involved so usually after

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,259
a midterm election the market goes up

175
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,240
this is pretty pretty well documented

176
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,580
it's pretty consistent since the year

177
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,360
1950 after every single midterm election

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
the market does a lot better no matter

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,620
which party wins no matter which party

180
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,840
is in power so is there is it like a

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
rational reason for this yeah so the

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
midterms generally are when there's like

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
a big shift in who controls the house

184
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
and the Senate right so typically

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,060
whoever is president during a midterm

186
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,340
election their party

187
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,620
does really poorly right the other party

188
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,720
ends up taking control of one or both

189
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
houses or keeping control if they

190
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
already had it so there's this split

191
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,440
government so for example like if the

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,940
House and Senate are both controlled by

193
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,740
Republicans but the president is

194
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,500
Democrat that's a split government or if

195
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,060
the House and Senate are split that's

196
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,979
considered a split Congress and the

197
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,740
stock market apparently really loves a

198
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,840
split government wow maybe the only part

199
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
of society that loves a Congress that

200
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,039
can't get anything done yeah right and

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,560
it is because the stock market sort of

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,160
gets like reassured that no big policy

203
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,740
changes no big spending is going to go

204
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,240
through in the next two years because

205
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,539
basically nothing happens when there's a

206
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,039
split government right when there's

207
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,320
gridlock it's a bit of a breather yeah

208
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,360
when there's gridlock no one can pass

209
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,039
any laws and so there's a lot less

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,200
uncertainty which of course the market

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,419
loves and okay that's starting to make

212
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,260
sense

213
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,540
um now at the moment we still don't know

214
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,820
the final results right it's so too

215
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,740
close to call but I do want to say that

216
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,060
all of this is just kind of like

217
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,339
historically speaking right all of this

218
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,640
might not actually mean a whole lot this

219
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,260
year just because there's so much going

220
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,180
on right now we had historic spending

221
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,740
because of the pandemic High inflation

222
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,360
High interest rates that the Federal

223
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Reserve says needs to stay high people

224
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,740
are worried about a recession there's

225
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,440
Russia's war in Ukraine all of this will

226
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,300
affect the stock market though so like

227
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,580
who knows uh an interesting thing is

228
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,540
that like a certain split is apparently

229
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,580
more Market friendly and it is when

230
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,760
there is a republican Congress under a

231
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,220
Democrat president that is apparently

232
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,100
the best environment for stocks thank
