is the indicator from Planet Money I'm

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,139
Waylon Wong and I'm Darian Woods the

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,420
debate over how to curb gun violence in

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,000
the US has arrived at the doorstep of

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,160
the financial industry and more

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
specifically companies linked to credit

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
cards within all the infrastructure that

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,820
undergirds the credit card industry

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,340
there is one little piece of it that has

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,980
gotten thrust into this conversation and

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,440
it is called the merchant category code

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
gun control Advocates believe the

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
merchant category code could be an

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,260
important tool in identifying suspicious

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,260
gun sales but getting retailers plus

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,700
other players in the credit card

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,520
industry to use this tool is another

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,700
thing today on the show we zoom in in on

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,920
this humble bit of financial Plumbing to

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
see how it works and why it's getting

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,520
the spotlight and the gun violence

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,940

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,400
in 2018 Andrew Ross Sulkin got curious

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,439
about something he's a economist and

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,939
editor at large at the New York Times

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,740
where he covers the financial industry

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,140
after the school shooting in Parkland

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,540
Florida in February of that year Andrew

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,240
started thinking where the gunman in

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
mass shootings getting the money for

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,340
their guns it started with a hunch that

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
people couldn't afford to buy all of

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,420
these guns in paraphernalia

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,659
without the financing element the credit

43
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,600
piece from a credit card Andrew started

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,460
digging and found that a significant

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,860
number of Shooters did use credit cards

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,840
the gunman behind the Pulse Nightclub

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,899
attack in 2016 for example charged over

48
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,420
twenty thousand dollars in weapons on

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,000
multiple credit cards and what stood out

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
to Andrea was that before carrying out

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,380
the attack the gunman had Googled terms

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,200
like credit card unusual spending and

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,140
why Banks stopped your purchases to me

54
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,140
that was proof positive

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,780
that the banks and the credit card

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,300
system were in fact financing these

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,800
shootings there was no other way to

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,840
think about it and the financial system

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,300
already uses data and sophisticated

60
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,459
algorithms to detect illegal activities

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,040
like fraud and money laundering so

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,900
Andrew thought what if there was a way

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,239
to identify suspicious spending activity

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,879
at gun stores now credit card companies

65
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,160
and Banks don't collect product level

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
data on what specific items people are

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
buying with their cards but the one

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,819
thing that is communicated back to all

69
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,379
of those folks

70
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,959
is the merchant category code the

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,000
merchant category code so let's talk

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,160
about what this is the merchant category

73
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,340
code or MCC for short is a four digit

74
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,680
number that's used to categorize a

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,660
business by what they primarily sell

76
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,400
that could be cat food or concert

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,620
tickets or refrigerator repair and the

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,360
industry uses these Merchant category

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,760
codes in a few different ways one

80
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
example is reward programs you know like

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
credit cards that give you double points

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
for your groceries you get those points

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
when you use your card at a business

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,659
that is categorized as a grocery store

85
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,000
another way the industry uses these

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,280
codes is to gather data on consumer

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,560
spending David shipper is a strategic

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,599
advisor at a Financial Services Research

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
firm called it navarica group Merchant

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
category of codes really help to Define

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
volume and see where things are moving

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,040
in different types of or lines of

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,780
business like grocery department stores

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,840
hotels I mean without them it really

95
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,360
would be difficult to understand as a

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,180
card issuer where your consumers are

97
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,580
spending money Merchant category codes

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,400
have been around since 2003 and they're

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,260
managed by a group in Geneva Switzerland

100
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,819
called the okay are you ready for this

101
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,099
name Darian I'm ready they're called The

102
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,140
International Organization for

103
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,659
standardization standardization so like

104
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,060
no free expression Allowed no not at all

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,640
but really the iso is the authority that

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
approves or rejects requests for new

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,798
codes based on criteria like is the

108
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,779
proposed new category distinct enough

109
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,720
from the categories that already exist

110
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
and do the businesses in the category

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,620
generate at least 10 million dollars in

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,160
annual sales so this Swiss organization

113
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,259
maintains the list of codes and then the

114
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,360
codes are assigned to businesses by

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,940
Banks and here's how that works let's

116
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,220
say I'm opening a new Candy Shop in my

117
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,919
town and I want to accept credit cards I

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
need to open an account with a bank that

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,180
can handle those transactions for me the

120
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,040
bank will ask me what's your primary

121
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,380
line of business and I'll say candy so

122
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,419
the Bank assigns me the merchant

123
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,000
category code for candy nuts and

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,160
confectionary stores and if I were to

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,199
pursue my true dream which is to open a

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,840
wig store there is a specific code just

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,820
for Wig and dupe stores believe it or

128
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
not there is also one for snowmobile

129
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,580
dealers or this is one of my favorites

130
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,440
detective agencies and security services

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,979
including armored cars and guard dogs so

132
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,199
these category codes can get pretty

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,620
specific even so until September there

134
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,660
wasn't a code specifically for stores

135
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,180
that sell guns and ammunition those

136
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,340
businesses are usually designated as

137
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,620
Sporting Goods or miscellaneous and

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,780
Andrew Ross Sorkin thought what if there

139
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,660
was a new code just for gun stores so

140
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,460
the financial industry could have a

141
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,139
chance at potentially spotting

142
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,500
suspicious activity so in 2018 he

143
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,479
started writing and giving talks about

144
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,720
this idea and One bank took notice

145
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,180
Amalgamated Bank it submitted an

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,400
application to the iso and Switzerland

147
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,100
for a new Merchant category code and

148
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,800
after an initial rejection the iso

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
approved the request and David said that

150
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,380
caused quite a stir I would say this is

151
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,419
probably the first time MCC codes have

152
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,900
ever made news wow big day for MCC codes

153
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,440
I know yeah the big win the new code was

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,940
considered a win by gun control

155
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,759
Advocates but a Firearms trade

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
Association and almost two dozen

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,380
Republican Attorneys General are bulking

158
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,560
at the idea saw some lawmakers at a

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
recent Congressional hearing with bank

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,580
CEOs representative Roger Williams of

161
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,580
Texas said the new code is an invasion

162
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,860
of privacy anyone who is against the

163
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,199
rights of gun owners will want your

164
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,060
institutions to flag every single

165
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,600
transaction with a gun MCC to law

166
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699
enforcement David says that it's not

167
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,440
clear how effect of the new Merchant

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,840
category code will actually be as a way

169
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,360
to spot suspicious purchases for

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,979
starters the code is like a blunt

171
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,560
instrument it only identifies the type

172
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,300
of business where a credit card is used

173
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,340
it doesn't give any information about

174
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,400
what was purchased so if you think

175
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,759
about a you know gun and ammunition

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
store if you go there and you purchase a

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
hunting bow

178
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
the MCC code is not going to know that

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,819
you purchased that versus a shotgun it's

180
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,039
not going to know that you purchased

181
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,620
ammunition versus maybe you purchased a

182
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,300
lot of candy and then there's the

183
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,099
question of whether the new Merchant

184
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,800
category code will get used at all so

185
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
remember we mentioned earlier that Banks

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,599
assign the codes to the businesses and

187
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,580
gun stores are usually designated as

188
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,039
Sporting Goods or miscellaneous so for

189
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,840
this new code to actually get used

190
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,759
stores and their Banks would have to

191
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,039
work together to reclassify the store

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,740
David says he doesn't really see that

193
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,440
happening and he's also skeptical that

194
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,479
newly opened gun stores will want this

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,940
code assigned to them and meanwhile the

196
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,740
big payment card networks visa and

197
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,660
MasterCard they responded to the

198
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,880
controversy by saying they respect the

199
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,919
privacy of their cardholders the

200
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,539
companies said they do not track

201
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,000
personal purchasing habits nor do they

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,099
block legal transactions based on

203
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,960
Merchant category codes

204
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,479
Visa said it doesn't think these codes

205
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,120
can or should be used to track purchases

206
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,120
like gun sales the company even said we

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
do not believe private companies should

208
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
serve as moral Arbiters so at the moment

209
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,199
the new Merchant category code exists

210
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,180
but it needs financial institutions to

211
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,879
embrace it and both David and Andrew see

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,979
ways that people can avoid getting their

213
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,419
transactions flagged like they could

214
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,940
just switch to cash but Andrew says he

215
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,559
hopes the new code will inspire

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,899
continued debate and reflection in the

217
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,120
financial industry about how those

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,559
businesses can help reduce gun violence

219
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,060
