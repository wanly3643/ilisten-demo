00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,980
the brightest flashlight app was

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,800
developed for something very simple this

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
was during the time when a lot of

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,859
Android phones didn't have built-in

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,380
flashlights like the iPhone so this app

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,359
would turn on all the available lights

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,699
essentially making the phone into a

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,680
flashlight but the brightest flashlight

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,439
was also doing something else it was

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
recording users locations and sending

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
that information to advertisers and this

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,640
landed the company in hot water with the

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,680
Federal Trade Commission that was almost

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,500
a decade ago since then the market for

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,840
location data has continued to flourish

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,899
it is a multi-billion dollar industry

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,000
where information on people's precise

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
whereabouts is still being collected for

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
mobile apps and sold to companies or

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,739
government agencies often without users

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,260
knowledge or direct consent

Mobile location data how it's gathered

One developer about his experience to

try to build a weather app that takes

privacy seriously

our phones contain a treasure Trove of

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,579
information about us what we're watching

40
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,520
buying searching for and where we are

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,579
precise geolocation data is really your

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,439
longitude and your latitude so exactly

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,840
where you are like you are in your

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,119
living room in your apartment Lena Gomez

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,399
a privacy lawyer a couple of years ago

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,560
she helped launch a watchdog group that

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,020
investigated mobile apps this was also

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,640
when more investigative journalism was

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,979
coming out about the industry like in

50
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,560
2020 Vice reported that the U.S military

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,020
was buying location data collected from

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,080
a variety of apps usually what happens

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,940
is that apps are collecting information

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,940
about you the apps then turn around and

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,680
sell that information to data Brokers

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,140
third parties who then package that data

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,599
repurpose it and then sell it to

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,540
anyone that wants to buy the data later

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,060
says location data can be helpful like

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,000
say an epidemiologist wants to track the

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,739
spread of infectious diseases in a

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,720
population or a real estate company

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,400
might want to analyze foot traffic

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
patterns when deciding where to open a

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
store and then there are apps that

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,160
simply wouldn't work without knowing

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,780
their users locations think of

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,879
navigation and mapping apps or ride

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,099
sharing apps like Lyft and Uber so it's

70
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,640
not all nefarious and bad but

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,959
unfortunately the way that it's been

72
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,239
used today has exploited individuals

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
because this information is really

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,620
sensitive one high profile example from

75
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,260
last year involved a Catholic priest he

76
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,480
resigned after a new site claimed to

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,760
have linked his phone with data showing

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,680
that he had visited gay bars and used

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,900
the location-based dating app grinder

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,239
and location data came under renewed

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,580
scrutiny after Roe v Wade was overturned

82
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
Congress is investigating privacy

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,959
concerns related to period tracking apps

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,580
and how they collect data including

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,540
location

86
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,780
and in August the FTC sued a data broker

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,360
named kochava it said the company's data

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
could be used to track people visiting

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
sensitive places like reproductive

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,819
health clinics and domestic violence

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,280
shelters so how does location data get

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,799
from an app to a data broker to

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,299
companies that are paying for this

94
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,000
information Lena says that often the app

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,220
developers have no idea that this data

96
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,599
is being collected in the first place

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,459
and that's because of something called

98
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,640
software development kits or sdks

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
basically they're pieces of code that

100
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,280
app developers use when creating an App

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,140
instead of writing the code from scratch

102
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,900
so think about making spaghetti you

103
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,760
could spend hours simmering a complex

104
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,220
bolognese sauce on the stove or you

105
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,260
could buy a jar of pre-made sauce and

106
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,000
get dinner on the table in 15 minutes

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,418
yeah so sdks are these pre-made Jarred

108
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,298
pasta sources of the mobile app industry

109
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,400
they contain pre-made software for

110
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
functions like taking credit card

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
payments or sending instant messages so

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
sdks can be very useful but unbeknownst

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,940
to app developers some SDK creators

114
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,979
insert location tracking capabilities

115
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,080
into their software and sell that data

116
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,360
to Brokers what happens a lot of time is

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,580
that the SDK has what we call invisible

118
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,120
code and the code can then extract your

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,500
location information and the app

120
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,479
developers actually sometimes don't even

121
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
know that they're putting this into the

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
app some developers choose to avoid sdks

123
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,979
altogether for this very reason

124
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,720
developers like Brian Mueller I'm Brian

125
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,360
Mueller and I'm the founder of carrot

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,699
weather this uh snarky little weather

127
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,620
app that has this personality built into

128
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,300
it I'm sick of these vanilla weather

129
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,940
apps yeah well if you want a weather app

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,620
kind of spicing up your life carrot

131
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,600
weather might be your thing because okay

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
every time you open this app you are

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,759
greeted with a rude message like if it's

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,820
sunny and warm carrot might say I hope

135
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
you get a horrible sunburn this is quite

136
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,560
the app I don't know why people would

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,060
want this in their life but maybe I

138
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,500
don't know self-flagellation is a thing

139
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,419
maybe just to feel alive does it feel

140
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,940
alive you know I have learned that

141
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,580
carrots personality is pretty acerbic

142
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,380
and it's sometimes bordering on

143
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,259
homicidal but one thing that carrot does

144
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,300
not do despite being a weather app is

145
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,820
collect and store precise location data

146
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,039
a few few years ago when Brian started

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
reading about how invisible code could

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,960
be lurking inside sdks he decided to

149
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,180
remove them from his app he also doesn't

150
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,100
sell ads because he didn't want to

151
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
expose his customers data to third-party

152
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,960
advertising companies I remember joking

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
that carrot wants your location data so

154
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,820
that she can use it to like send an

155
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,639
assassin after you not not give it to

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,860
someone else to Market stuff to you so

157
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,660
one challenge for Brian is that he has

158
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,580
to rely on third party weather data

159
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,259
providers you know like the companies

160
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,780
that actually do the forecasts and he

161
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,699
can't control what those companies do

162
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,120
with his customers data so he's built a

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,819
couple of safeguards for example he puts

164
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,160
his own servers in between his customers

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,500
and the weather data providers that way

166
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
those companies don't see his customers

167
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,300
IP addresses they only see requests

168
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,580
coming from Brian's servers and another

169
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,639
thing that I do is uh my request to the

170
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,759
weather data providers don't use the

171
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,060
most precise GPS coordinates I round

172
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,039
those coordinates up so that they'll

173
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,979
never be able to like say that this user

174
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,800
is at this specific address Brian says

175
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,199
though as a consumer he personally

176
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,720
doesn't mind his location being used for

177
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,180
targeted ads and this is a pretty common

178
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,940
mindset like our online experience can

179
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,620
be more tailored to our interests

180
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
because of the information that we

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
provide to apps and advertisers and ads

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
are what enables so many apps and

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,660
services to be free but the conversation

184
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,520
station around how sensitive personal

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,800
information gets used is prompting

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,960
people like Brian to take a hard look at

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,580
the trade-offs between privacy

188
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,460
convenience and in his case making a

189
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,440
living as an app developer there's so

190
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,720
many cases out there where location data

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,099
can be used

192
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,560
to really hurt people

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
and that's the kind of stuff that I

194
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,580
don't want to contribute to both Brian

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,620
and Lena say that because the US doesn't

196
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,960
have a federal Privacy Law like Europe's

197
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
gdpr law it's largely been left up to

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,180
individual companies and developers to

199
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,460
figure out their own policies Apple for

200
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,380
example introduced privacy features last

201
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
year that let iPhone users opt out of

202
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,120
getting tracked by advertisers privacy

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
Advocates applauded the features but

204
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
those changes also resulted in billions

205
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
of lost dollars in ad revenue and sales

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,639
for companies and for individual people

207
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,520
like Lena the wild west nature of the

208
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,800
mobile app industry means that she has

209
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,560
to stay personally Vigilant not only for

210
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,500
herself but her parents too who aren't

211
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,840
as tech savvy as she is I look at their

212
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,099
phone and I'm like do you really need

213
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,840
these apps what's like the most random

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,160
app you found on your parents phone

215
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,360
where you're like no you don't need this

216
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,000
my mom had this like flower of the day

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
app

218
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,599
night I was like what is this and she

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,299
was like I don't know look nice I was

220
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,399
like you don't need this

221
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,320
well the sunflower might look nice but

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,940
you can also get insulted by a really

223
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,559
mean weather app if you want who

224
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,899
wouldn't want that 24 000 people are

225
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,000
killed by lightning every year will you

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
be one of them

227
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,860
well that estimate sounds a little high

228
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,080
but I wouldn't dare contradict carrot

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,060
she will come for me I would know that

230
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,880
she knows where you live maybe not the

231
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,320
address but where you live generally

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,420
this episode was produced by Nikki

234
