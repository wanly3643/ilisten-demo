00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,939
new jobs report is out today and it's

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,359
that the U.S economy added 261 000 jobs

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,820
in October the unemployment rate Rose

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
slightly to 3.7 percent but there's

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,880
still 1.9 jobs for every one unemployed

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,100
person some of these jobs are ones that

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,079
businesses have trouble filling with

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,059
American workers even when they

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,059
advertise widely or raise wages and a

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,440
potential solution for this hiring

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,739
shortfall is immigration now there are

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,780
lots of ways foreign workers come to the

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,600
U.S one of them is a Visa program that

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,699
businesses from vacation resorts to

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,100
Seafood processors rely on to staff

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,559
their busy seasons

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,359
today on the show we will learn about

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,459
this program with the potential to

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,159
alleviate Staffing shortages and we look

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,680
at new economic research that shows when

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
businesses hire foreign workers through

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,280
this program they end up actually

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,310
creating new jobs for Americans

[Music]

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,040
for years temperate temporary foreign

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
workers have been coming to the U.S for

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
months at a time to process salmon in

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,060
Alaska and pick crabs in Maryland they

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,860
clean hotel rooms and work in the

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,479
kitchens of ski resorts in the winter

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,820
and beach resorts in the summer a lot of

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,439
them also work in groundskeeping and

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,020
Forestry Economist Michael Clemens is a

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,640
senior fellow at the center for Global

development where he studies migration

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
and Michael says that evidence of

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,939
temporary foreign workers is all around

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,340
us if you see a right-of-way through the

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
forest for utility lines somebody needs

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
to clear the vegetation From Below those

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,759
so the forest doesn't come back if

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,320
there's a pulp paper Forest somebody

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,259
needs to go in a remote area and do the

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,119
difficult physical labor of planting all

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,100
those seedlings many of these workers

52
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,399
have what are called h2b visas this is a

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,199
Visa program that hires temporary

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,180
foreign workers without college degrees

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,599
for non-agricultural jobs every year the

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
US government hands out 66 000 h2b visas

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,940
split between the winter and the summer

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,800
the workers hail from country countries

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
like Mexico Guatemala Jamaica Serbia and

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,980
the Philippines and the h-2b Visa was

61
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,580
almost not to be for nearly seven

62
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,239
decades starting in 1885 the U.S banned

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,860
foreign workers without advanced

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,580
education but in 1952 The post-world War

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,280
II Labor Market had a lot of jobs and

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,560
not enough workers and that's when the

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,319
h-2b Visa was created it was designed to

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,480
be a way to hire foreign workers when

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
there was literally no other option in

70
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,500
other words when businesses couldn't

71
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,660
find any American workers to take a job

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,040
at that wage

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,379
but lawmakers were concerned that

74
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,239
foreign workers would replace their

75
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,519
American counterparts so they put in

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
restrictions that remain in place today

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
for example the h-2b jobs have to be

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,140
limited in time like seasonal or one-off

79
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,659
work and employers have to certify with

80
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,819
the government that no American is

81
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,860
willing and able to do the job the

82
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,720
Department of Labor can ask for evidence

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,180
of recruitment activities did you

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,920
advertise in newspapers did you

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,140
advertise on the radio when people came

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,400
to you through the State Workforce

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,500
agency saying I'm unemployed I would

88
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,060
like to work in speed food processing

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,340
what happened to them Michael points out

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,440
that these kinds of jobs can't or

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,659
haven't been automated and they're also

92
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,700
jobs that don't attract American workers

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,640
even at higher wages so remember when we

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,860
said that there's a yearly cap on h2b

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,459
visas of 66 000. well that limit was put

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,620
in place in 1990 when there were far

97
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,260
fewer h2b workers in the country around

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,040
20 000 workers so the cap of 66 000

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,860
seemed really generous at that time that

100
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,599
number was seen as so high that it would

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,180
never be reached well the number was

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,659
reached and then some in 2019 employers

103
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,480
requested triple the number of h2b visas

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,780
available for half a year by 2022 the

105
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,940
number of requests was four times the

106
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,680
quota and the government's tried some

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,139
stop Gap measures like in the law they

108
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,240
are allowed to extend the number of

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,780
visas by up to around 65 000 extra visas

110
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,100
and that's all they're going to do in

111
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,080
the coming year but whether a business

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,900
gets these visas depends a lot on luck

113
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,240
this is because when employers submit

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
their request to the Department of Labor

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,020
they get randomly assigned a letter of

116
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,540
the alphabet A through e the applicants

117
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,419
in the a group get evaluated first the

118
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,979
ones that don't get letter a end up

119
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,600
hiring about half as many as they would

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,880
otherwise prefer to it's not bigger

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,860
firms or smaller firms more productive

122
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,720
less productive it's it's literally just

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,759
the luck of the draw last month Michael

124
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,300
and Othello

125
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,520
businesses that won and lost the 2021

126
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,400
lottery for h2b visas and here's what

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
they found businesses that were able to

128
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,419
hire foreign workers the winners

129
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,060
produced 17 percent more stuff than the

130
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,460
losers the winners also spent triple the

131
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,800
amount on investing in their business in

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
other words just being able to hire h2b

133
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,419
workers unlocked productivity not just

134
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,820
for the foreign workers coming in but

135
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,639
for the entire company and Michael says

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
businesses that are expanding tend to

137
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,500
create more jobs for Americans if a

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,940
restaurant can operate because there is

139
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,100
a dishwasher that means not just more

140
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,800
jobs for people waiting tables it also

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
means more jobs for the accountants who

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,220
keep the books of the restaurant it

143
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,800
means more jobs for the people at the

144
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,080
businesses from which things are bought

145
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,820
by the owner of the restaurant with the

146
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,560
revenue they get because the restaurant

147
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,180
can operate because there is a

148
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,860
dishwasher there are all kinds of Ripple

149
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,900
effects Michael's analysis found that

150
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,539
businesses who couldn't hire h2b workers

151
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,479
their losers weren't able to to hire

152
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
American workers for the unfilled

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
positions either and the result was that

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,020
these businesses output and investment

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,199
fell industries that rely on h2b Visa

156
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
workers have shared anecdotes that align

157
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,699
with Michael's findings for example a

158
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,620
national landscape or organization said

159
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,900
this year that in past Seasons their

160
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,880
members have had to turn away customers

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
and cancel equipment purchases because

162
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,039
they didn't have enough hdb workers in

163
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,380
Colorado the Aspen skiing company used

164
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,080
to employ hundreds of hdb workers at its

165
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,780
four ski areas that was over a decade

166
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,020
ago last year it got approved for only a

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,020
couple of dozen h2p visas it is a little

168
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,539
nerve-wracking because you never know if

169
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,699
the government is going to approve you

170
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,819
to to have the amount that you've

171
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,340
requested that's Michaela Ford the

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,080
company's acting director of talent

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,300
acquisition she says the companies had

174
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,280
to get creative about seasonal Staffing

175
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
it has an arrangement with a hotel in

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,840
Colorado Springs that high hires h2b

177
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,060
workers for the summer season when the

178
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,100
summer ends those workers pack up and

179
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
head over to Aspen for the winter these

180
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,780
h-2b workers are known as in-country

181
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,080
extensions and this winter 55 of them

182
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,539
will be at Aspen skiing company Michaela

183
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,160
says she feels good about this year's

184
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,500
Staffing levels and one big benefit of

185
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,880
having enough workers for the peak

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,960
season we all get a go ski powder

187
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,460
seriously though we do get to take you

188
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,340
know ski breaks and for fully staffed if

189
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,740
we're understaffed you know that means

190
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,960
we're asking somebody maybe to stay

191
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,720
longer or to work an extra shift and

192
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
that can really weigh on someone it can

193
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,840
really impact a business and so that's

194
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,860
really why we do these Visa programs I

195
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,660
would love my brakes to be ski breaks

196
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,639
how do I sign up you got to relocate to

197
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
Aspen that's true and it's also not all

198
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,860
ski breaks and sunshine for these

199
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,500
seasonal workers many h2b workers

200
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
perform difficult physically demanding

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,880
jobs and they're often in these

202
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,340
precarious situations where they can't

203
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,620
speak up about unsafe conditions or

204
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,080
mistreatment you know their visas are

205
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,300
tied to their employer they also don't

206
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,060
have a pathway to citizenship in the US

207
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,580
Michael Clemens says the h2b Visa

208
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,080
program has needed improvements

209
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,300
basically since it was conceived but

210
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
progress has been stalled in the absence

211
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,500
of broader immigration reform it's

212
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
really hard to find somebody who will

213
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,020
put H2 visas on a bumper sticker and say

214
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,020
I love H2 visas that doesn't change the

215
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,659
fact that for several sectors that are

216
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,539
crucial for all of us foreign

217
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,860
fundamental workers are a major

218
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,679
constraint and this is the policy tool

219
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,740
that we have in order to give massive

220
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,959
opportunities to them and substantial

221
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,240
opportunities to American workers and to

222
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,580
the rest of the economy honk if you love

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
learning about the labor market that's

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,300
what's on my bumper sticker

225
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
um it's gonna sell well how do I buy in

226
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,260
let me get the printing press ready

227
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
foreign

228
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,920
this episode was produced by Nikki

229

Willett and engineered by Catherine

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Silva Noah Glick checked the facts via

231
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,800
laser senior producer Kate and Cannon

232
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,540

233
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,510
