3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,340
today the 12 members of what's known as

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,740
the Federal Open Market Committee or the

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,279
fomc made a big decision good afternoon

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,500
my colleagues and I are strongly

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,600
committed chair Jerome Powell announced

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,240
the fomc had decided to raise interest

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,820
rates three quarters of a percentage

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,759
point today and interest rates can be

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,820
suffocating for a lot of people

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,739
mortgages are more expensive car loans

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,780
and credit cards get harder to pay off

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,059
businesses stop hiring the overall

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,760
effect is designed to slow down the

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,280
economy to tackle inflation and instead

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,500
of debating whether the 12 members of

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,420
the fomc are making the right or the

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,680
wrong decisions

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,059
there's another way we could be

21
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,280
reimagining the feds work all together

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,340
we could be putting interest rates on

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,399
autopilot with the basic formula that a

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
high schooler could memorize the guide

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,900
is pretty simple when they followed it

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,580
has worked pretty well when they haven't

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,380
followed it it's not worked so well

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,840
Stanford economist John Taylor is

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
simple equation that could tell central

banks how much to raise or lower

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,060

strayed from this rule Today's Show what

automate how much to raise or lower

interest rates to keep inflation steady

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,439
and its Origins start in the 1970s back

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,380
then American monetary policy was a mess

50
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,720
inflation was out of control and

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,879
unemployment was high even more

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
fundamentally it was unclear how a

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,300
central bank should do Central Bank

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,540
things like the fed's Dual mandate the

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,819
core goal of keeping both prices stable

56
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,640
and Employment High that didn't even

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,599
exist until 1977. in the 70s everything

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,879
was up for debate John Taylor was an

59
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,800
economist then recently out of his PhD

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,840
he was working at the Council of

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,819
economic advisors under President Ford

62
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,700
there were all sorts of Chaos in the 70s

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,459
we had money growth High money growth

64
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,440
low it didn't seem like the way we

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,959
should be conducting policies so I

66
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,180
started with how can we conduct policy

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,360
in a more understandable way John almost

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,819
looking for a way to guide fed officials

69
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,739
towards keeping the economy growing

70
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,500
steadily not too much inflation not too

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,959
much unemployment in other words he was

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,300
looking for a recipe for a soup that

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,239
wouldn't be too salty or too sweet but a

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,800
lot of the recipes out there giving

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,780
models for how the central banks should

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,239
raise or lower interest rates had a lot

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
of inputs and equations exchange rates

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
government deficits may be the number of

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
ships lining up at the ports John didn't

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,640
think these models would work for policy

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,760
makers gee this recipe is so complicated

82
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,099
can we simplify we want it to be

83
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,500
available for everybody not just the

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,840
sophisticated people who know about all

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,700
the ingredients in the taste so John

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,560
would take out one ingredient at a time

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,720
and see how the model held up and

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,599
keeping a hypothetical economy satiated

89
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,060
it may be see if he could replace two

90
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,099
variables as one like I don't know

91
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,659
instead of both consumption and

92
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,280
investment he could replace these with

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,099
GDP which covers the whole economy he

94
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,620
was boiling it down meanwhile at the FED

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,080
under chair Paul volcker Central Banking

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,140
got more clarity yes it had its dual

97
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,540
mandate to keep prices stable and jobs

98
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,299
plentiful but in reality it was focusing

99
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,700
much more on the keeping prices stable

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,040
part of its mandate keeping inflation

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,738
low but John still felt like the FED

102
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,199
could be much clearer about how it went

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,740
about its business and in 1992 John was

104
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,840
asked to give a talk at Carnegie Mellon

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,000
University on what he'd been cooking

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,520
over all these years and the recipe was

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,340
essentially this raise interest rates by

108
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,740
more than the spike in inflation

109
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,960
so we have this inflation Target for the

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,780
fed that's two percent so let's say you

111
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,940
have inflation bumbling along at two

112
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,400
percent but then one day it spikes up to

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,280
three percent then the Taylor rule says

114
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
that you would raise interest rates by

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
one and a half percentage points that's

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,520
more than that one percentage Point bump

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,680
in inflation that we've just had and

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,880
you'd also take into account how

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,860
overheated or undercooked The Wider

120
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,440
economy is as well and those two factors

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,960
together inflation and the state of the

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,660
economy that's more or less it that's

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,759
the Taylor rule I didn't think it'd be

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,340
so important or useful that's for sure

125
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,400
it was like hey let's try this but I

126
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,040
caught on quite quickly and it worked

127
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,139
pretty well that's all John crunched the

128
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,479
numbers for his Rule and he found that

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,000
it described fairly closely what the

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,979
Federal Reserve had actually done in the

131
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,900
1980s and would go on to do in the 1990s

132
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,940
these were times described as the great

133
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,639
moderation when inflation was low and

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,400
any recessions were mild and when the

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
FED had deviated from the Taylor rule

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,479
where it hadn't raised interest rates as

137
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,759
much as the rule suggested that was the

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,580
1970s when inflation got so high that

139
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,380
the FED had to crash the economy in the

140
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,259
early 80s to stamp it out it was also in

141
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,479
the early 2000s when low interest rates

142
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,759
contributed to massive housing price

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,100
growth fueling the speculative bubble

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,740
that led to the Great Recession in 2008.

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,000
John felt like his historical analysis

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,160
Vindicated the Taylor rule if the rule

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
had been followed maybe we could have

148
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,720
avoided those crashes and as the years

149
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,180
go on John is trying to promote this

150
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,080
idea we have an autopilot for the FED we

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,500
have policy rules and in his view policy

152
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,900
rules like the Taylor rule work better

153
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,880
than human judgment most of the time

154
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,699
here's John testifying in 2014 at the

155
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,680
house Financial Services committee it's

156
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,479
because of the success of policy rules

157
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,180
that I recommend that legislation be put

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,880
in place to require the FED to report on

159
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,919
its policy Rule and for the next few

160
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,960
years there were efforts in Congress to

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,759
pass bills that would encourage the FED

162
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,280
to follow a rule like the Taylor rule

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,160
one bill required the FED to get audited

164
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,220
for an explanation if they deviated but

165
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,840
the proposed bills face strong

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,419
resistance notably from Janet Yellen

167
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,759
chair of the FED at the time she thought

168
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,520
this breached Fair Independence I am

169
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,340
very opposed and have on the record is

170
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,560
saying I am very opposed to energetic

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Yellen is speaking at Stanford

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,419
University in 2017. and John Taylor's in

173
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,960
the room and at first Janet Yellen is

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
complimentary consider first the

175
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,660
well-known Taylor rule we which embodies

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,300
key principles of good monetary policy

177
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,460
but you know what happens with a

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,740
compliment sandwich right the painful

179
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,080
stuff is in the middle exactly it's not

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
delicious Janet Yellen points out that

181
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,699
yes the formula is simple just plug in

182
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,919
inflation and where we are relative to

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,940
potential GDP but which indicators you

184
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,240
use for those matter a lot like do we

185
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,860
use the Consumer Price Index for

186
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,840
inflation or do we use the fed's

187
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,300
preferred consumption expenditures index

188
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,180
also Janet Yellen says that geopolitical

189
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,099
events like trade Wars might be on the

190
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,319
horizon things say only a committee of

191
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,300
human beings might be able to anticipate

192
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,120
Janet Yellen also gave evidence that the

193
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,639
Taylor rule just systematically gives

194
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,280
you interest rates that are too high it

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,319
doesn't take into account how shifts in

196
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,720
globalization and demographics have

197
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,300
pushed interest rates down overall in

198
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,759
the last few decades the Taylor rule for

199
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,800
this reason provides a problematic

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
benchmark the speech was a passionate

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
defense of human beings versus the

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
robotic formula of the Taylor rule and

203
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
the bill didn't pass but the FED did on

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
its own initiative start publishing

205
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,339
charts twice a year that showed what it

206
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,958
had been doing with interest rates and

207
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,299
compared that with the Taylor rule

208
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,580
and John says that has been insightful

209
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,980
in this pandemic economy under the

210
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,480
Taylor rule interest rates would have

211
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,980
risen to around seven or eight percent

212
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,240
last year

213
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,839
instead they stayed near zero I'd say

214
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,180
right now that most central banks are

215
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,860
still behind and it's not like they're

216
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,140
rushing to do this John is holding out

217
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,480
hope that our current High inflation

218
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,019
might revive interest in

219
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,459
institutionalizing his rule what you

220
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,720
have to say well look this worked pretty

221
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,760
well it looks like it'll work in the

222
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,100
future let's just do this and my My Hope

223
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,800
Is this experience will bring us more in

224
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,750
that direction rather than take us away

Taylor's version of the world is a world

227
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
without human beings it's just a

228
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
mathematical formula yeah maybe he's

229
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,120
right maybe we're the problem wow
