this is the integrated from Planet Money

I'm Darian woods and I'm Patty Hirsch at

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,940
the heart of every piece of Machinery

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,880
powered by electricity lies The Humble

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,500
magnet of course you know this from your

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,820
physics class at high school Darian

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,580
right oh yeah I was at the front row

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,260
anyway most magnets like the one in your

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,180
battery powered clock for example are

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,980
cheap and easy to produce but the

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,780
magnets in high-tech Machinery like

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,760
electric vehicle Motors or I don't know

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,739
space shuttle turbines are very

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,600
different these so-called permanent

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,120
magnets are subject to intense heat and

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,879
pressure and to make the really high-end

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,239
ones you need a special ingredient rare

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,460
Earths these are elements that can be

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,219
hard to find and are even harder to

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,260
extract and refine yeah and the vast

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,699
majority of rare Earths right now are

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,860
produced in China which means that China

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,500
dominates that market recently however

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,480
scientists discovered a way to produce a

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,820
metal in a lab that could be used to

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,580
make high-end magnets without using rare

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,220
Earths the metal is called tetratanite

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,140
and on today's show we're going to find

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,600
out what it is how it's made and how it

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,220
came from space that's right and we're

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,140
going to hear how it could transform not

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,880
just the market for rare Earths and

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,159
permanent magnets but the balance of

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,320
technological power between China and

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,299
the West that's all coming up after the

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:27,640

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,159
to understand all about tetraonite we

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,479
called up one of the scientists who

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,460
helped make it in the lab I am Laura

Henderson Lewis I am a professor of

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,540
in Boston Massachusetts we also called

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,820
an investor who tracks technologies that

55
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,038
use rare Earths my name is Jonathan

hikaway and I'm the president of

stormcrow capital limited Jonathan is

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
tremendously excited by the news that

59
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
scientists may have found a way to

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,819
create a metal that could remove the

61
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,920
need to use rare Earths in some high-end

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
magnets this new discovery this this

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,379
tetrotainite announcement is one of the

64
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,879
most interesting things I've seen in the

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,720
space

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,900
and I look at a dozen of these sorts of

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,959
discoveries a week

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
99.9 of them will never become

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,220
commercial this one actually might

70
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,680
tejate Knight is not an unknown medal

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,420
but Laura says it is pretty

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,660
extraordinary tetrotenai is a cosmic

73
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,620
mineral

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,459
and it was first discovered and named in

75
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,560
the 1980s and when Laura says

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,140
tetrotainite is Cosmic she means that in

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,480
its natural form it literally comes from

78
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,480
isospace it's only found in a few

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
meteorites some of them are in the

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,379
Smithsonian it's made out of two common

81
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,379
Metals iron and nickel which bonded and

82
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,920
cooled over a very very long time while

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
the meteorite was spinning around up

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,700
there in the cosmos and that doesn't

85
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,120
happen very quickly naturally so it

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
could take up to you know many millions

87
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,659
up to a billion years to form a large

88
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,300
piece of tetrotaini at replicating a

89
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,640
billion year cooling process in a lab is

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,260
challenging and perhaps not surprisingly

91
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,239
rather expensive I mean good luck

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,500
getting a lease for that length of time

93
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,900
yeah but Jonathan hike away says the

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,120
benefits are potentially huge that's

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,159
because iron a nickel are dirt cheap

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,379
compared to rare Earths like neodymium

97
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,480
or terbium that we currently need to use

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,099
when we make high performance permanent

99
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,560
magnets today neodymium oxide is true

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,180
trading at about a hundred dollars it's

101
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,680
a hundred and four dollars a kilo

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,659
terbium oxide which is one of the

103
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,879
materials that allows magnets made with

104
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,440
it to function at much higher

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,200
temperatures than it normally would

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,580
that's trading at something like one

107
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,620
thousand nine hundred dollars a kilogram

108
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,299
but nickel and iron on the other hand

109
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,540
trade for less than 25 bucks a kilogram

110
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,340
so you can see the cost saving

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,319
implications here if we can make

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,939
permanent magnets out of such

113
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,400
inexpensive materials it's got the

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,220
possibility and the potential of of

115
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,738
actually crippling the existing Rare

116
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,540
Earth Market crippling well that's you

117
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,100
heard it here first watch out Rare Earth

118
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,800
Market Yan rarests are expensive not

119
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,060
because they're difficult to mine

120
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,100
although some are the problem is that

121
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,360
they're usually combined with other

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,100
materials and it's the process of

123
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,080
separating them to get that raw element

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
that's so difficult you dig The Ore out

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
of the ground

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,500
you you grind it you beneficiate it you

127
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,820
pull out those Rare earth-bearing

128
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,620
Minerals you subject them to an acid

129
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,199
leech to pull the metals out getting the

130
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,780
individual rare it's out is extremely

131
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,000
difficult the US used to be a leader in

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,380
the rare Earth's business back in the

133
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,199
1980s but Laura says that production was

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,320
so expensive and so messy that the US

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,380
decided to Outsource to China So Not

136
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,199
only was China blessed with a large

137
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,320
deposit of rare Earth elements it's in

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,940
inner Mongolia

139
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,940
uh but they were also willing to put in

140
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,680
the infrastructure

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,620
to separate these elements and the U.S

142
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,979
was not so particularly interested uh in

143
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,419
doing that especially if China would do

144
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,900
it for a reduced overhead because the

145
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,300
processing is not particularly

146
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,680
environmentally friendly the 30 years

147
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,199
old Jonathan says China effectively owns

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,360
the rare Earth's Market almost all of

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,639
the processing and quantity in terms of

150
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,759
separating out pure neodymium oxide pure

151
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,699
prasodemium oxide or a mix of the two

152
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,680
that's pure enough to be used in magnets

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,979
is done in China almost all of the

154
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,680
conversion of those oxide materials to

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,919
Metals is done in China and a very large

156
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,139
proportion of the actual magnet alloy

157
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,660
manufacturing is done in China China

158
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,820
controls more than 71 percent of the

159
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,520
world's extraction and 87 percent of the

160
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,259
world's processing capacity of rare

161
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,880
Earths it also makes more than 80

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
percent of the world's permanent magnets

163
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,680
Jonathan says that if tetratayanite is a

164
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,080
viable success most permanent magnets

165
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
could be produced at a fraction of their

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,280
current cost that would turn the magnet

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,800
Market on its head and also the market

168
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,380
in rare Earths this is going to be a

169
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,360
fairly big disruption to a lot of

170
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,340
companies the the Chinese companies or

171
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,780
the producers are going to have to start

172
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,039
worrying about

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,900
what their economics are going to look

174
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,720
like if they're only selling a fraction

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,340
of the amount that they used to the

176
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,479
magnets that go into your electric

177
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,340
scooter or your air conditioner would be

178
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,960
cheaper which would be a win for

179
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
consumers but there could be a big

180
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,979
downside some rare Earths could end up

181
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,780
becoming more expensive because it would

182
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,460
be less incentive to mine and extract

183
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,560
them and that could be a problem for a

184
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,479
range of other Industries and that's

185
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,940
because rare Earths aren't only used in

186
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,160
magnet manufacturing they're also key

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,960
components and all kinds of high-tech

188
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,940
applications from fiber optics to

189
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,340
radiation scanners to Advanced military

190
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,319
equipment if suddenly the rare earth

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,639
industry can't afford to dig the

192
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,680
material out of the ground because we

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,660
can't sell magnet materials the

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,000
availability of things like luticium

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,060
erbium for the fiber optic industry and

196
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,419
some of these other small quantity quite

197
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,099
rare rare it's

198
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
is going to suffer as a result and these

199
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,780
markets aren't huge the rare Earth's

200
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,180
Market is somewhere between 12 and 16

201
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,880
billion dollars a year and just for

202
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
scale that is about the size of the

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,419
global market for gin oh really

204
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,819
permanent magnets that's about 34

205
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,620
billion which is about the size of the

206
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,840
global market for orange juice somewhat

207
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
less interesting so the disruption of

208
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,020
either the magnets Market or the rare

209
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,940
Earth's Market wouldn't hurt China that

210
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,099
much financially but strategically it's

211
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,139
a whole other question the demand for a

212
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,880
high-end permanent magnets is growing

213
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,460
fast and these magnets are vital to all

214
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,539
sorts of products that are going to

215
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,520
become increasingly important as the

216
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,080
world transitions to a clean energy

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,699
economy so of course I'm talking about

218
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,860
things like electric vehicles industrial

219
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,139
air conditioners and wind turbines and

220
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,300
so it's in China's interest to stay on

221
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,280
top of the markets and magnets and rare

222
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Earths and the US knows it and that's

223
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,539
why there's been talk about America

224
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,580
moving back into the rare Earth's

225
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,180
business but the us only has one mine

226
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,680
running at the moment that's in

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
California yeah and bringing new

228
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,479
facilities online will take years which

229
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,460
makes the lab production of tetrotainite

230
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,259
look kind of like a gift of magical

231
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,720
alien technology from outer space which

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
it sort of is just without the aliens

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,339
but Laura Lewis at Northeastern says

234
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,219
it's no quick fix having this is not the

235
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,740
same as having a magnet I often use the

236
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,899
analogy you may have a material to make

237
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,919
a brick

238
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,540
but you have to put the bricks together

239
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,399
to make a wall and then that wall makes

240
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,260
the Taj Mahal she says there's no

241
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,899
guarantee that the lab tattoo night will

242
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,880
work as well as the tiny bits of metal

243
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,060
mine from the meteorites even if it does

244
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,399
nothing will happen overnight yeah best

245
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,080
case she says it could be five to eight

246
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
years before Tetra tonight could make a

247
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,740
meaningful difference to the magnet

248
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,420
production business or to The Rare Earth

249
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,760
Markets until then the race is on to

250
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,740
compete with China and to secure new

251
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,019
sources of rare Earths far in the

252
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,420
Australian desert deep under the seabed

253
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,860
in Japan

254
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,860
maybe in outer space yeah I mean once

255
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,660
you've run out of land that's my guess

256
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,160
as we have to go it is the final

257
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,720
frontier it is after all the final

258
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,140
frontier

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,700
this show was produced by Noah Glick

260
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,140
with engineering from Maggie Luthor

261
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,240
Dylan Sloan checked the facts via Leia's

262
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
our senior producer cake and Cannon

263
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,540
edits the show and the indicator is a

264
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,580
production of NPR

265
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,040
visit meteorite or meteoroid fatty so

266
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,420
here's the thing when it's in space it's

267
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,459
a meteoroid okay when it hits the

268
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,140
atmosphere and it burns you've got that

269
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,420
shooting star thing that's a meteor and

270
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,920
if it survives that and it hits the

271
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,019
earth that is a meteorite
